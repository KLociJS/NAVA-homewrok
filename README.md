# Project Name: Image Management System

## Description:
The Image Management System is a user-friendly web application meticulously crafted for effortless image data management. Utilizing React.js and Material-UI, it boasts a sophisticated and responsive interface that seamlessly adjusts to various screen sizes. While it currently operates with mocked API calls and randomly generated images, its design prioritizes functionality and user experience.

## Usage:
To toggle between successful and unsuccessful API responses, modify the `IS_API_RESPONSE_SUCCESSFUL` variable in the `src/constants/constants.js` file. By default, it is set to `true`.
